This is a pet project to dip my feet back into the world of Python. This readme will be fleshed out more as I progress.

# Description

This is a Discord bot that provides the ability to monitor and manage a DCS World server without the need to log onto a physical server.

The plan is to allow this bot to change mission details and check the status of or restart the DCS server. As such, this bot must run on the same server that DCS is hosted on.

Inspired by the guys at DCS Refugee Camp, and [navavisr18](https://github.com/nadavisr18).
